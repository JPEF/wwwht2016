This app is developed on a web course as a project work in autumn 2016.

The point of this app is to get images from Imgur's Subreddit galleries 
specified by user, using Imgur API. The required subreddit information can also 
be gathered from users Reddit account utilizing Reddit API. One requirement
for this project was that it would look minimalistic and the images would
look good in all screen sizes without need from user to scroll around to see 
the whole image.

The app utilizes these two librarys:
1. https://github.com/adoy/PHP-OAuth2
2. https://github.com/bndr/imgur-php-wrapper
